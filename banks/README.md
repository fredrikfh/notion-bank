A bank file should have a send_to_notion function that takes a list of transactions and sends them to Notion.

```

1. Open a file with bank statement
2. Find the transactions
3. Parse the transactions
4. Create a notion page using the create_page function
5. Add a relationship to the bank page using the add_relationship function
6. Send the transactions to the page using the send_to_notion function
```
